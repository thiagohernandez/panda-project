/*
 * This folder contains FTBs personal fork of PHPixie 2.0.
 *
 * nb. There are many changes to PHPixie, particularly
 * with regard to the file organisation and the way
 * plugins/extensions are accessed.
 *
 *
 * The folders are:
 *
 * 'core' - the essential PHPixie files (the minimum needed
 *          for a working PHPixie application).
 *
 * 'modules' - The essential addon modules for making a CRM-type
 *             application with PHPixie (database+auth). These
 *             addons are all accessed via the Pixie object.
 *
 * 'plugins' - Non-essential addons for PHPixie applications
 *             (these modules were originally included with
 *              PHPixie, I put them in this folder).
 *
 * A copy of the original PHPixie 2.0 documentation is included
 * for convenience/safety. Open "phpixie.html" to access it. :-)
